We know how it is hard to get better by yourself and recognize your own mistakes without advices, with that in mind, we created `Opinaton`. 

`Opinaton` is an app made in order to help hackathon participants to have more insights or opportunities after a hackathon ending.

The logic of the app revolves around the following process:
- A hackathon is happening.
- The hackathon's organizer opens the app and chooses which team is going to present the pitch.
- The team that is presenting the pitch receives real-time feedback from other hackathon's participants and this feedback can be later reviewed.

You can see a **Demo** of this app on:

## Dependencies
We recommend you use the `npm` in order to run this app locally. You must use the following commands on the `client` and the `api` separately.
```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Important Notes
This app is a PWA because it was made focused on the usability and the agility our world desires nowadays.
Our thought was that during hackathons presentations you would be probabily closer to a smartphone with internet connection than a computer.

The initial idea was to use the Shawee's API to provide data but since we could not, we created our own simplified API.

To test the online demo, we recommend you to log into the app with the following credentials:
```sh
user@gmail.com #email
12345 #password
```
